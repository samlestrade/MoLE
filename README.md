MoLE is an R package for simulating language evolution in terms of cultural evolution. The focus is on the emergence of argument-marking systems (i.e. noun marking, person indexing, word order), but extensions are foreseen.

To run, 
install the package in your R library;
set the model parameters in object "world";
found a new population with "FOUND()", and
start a simulation with "RUN()".

For language to change (and argument-marking grammar to develop), the simulation has to run for several hours.
