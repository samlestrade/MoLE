R codes for replicating the results in "Unzipping Zipf's law"

Three files with codes (and comments)::

script: These codes can be used to reproduce all figures and tables in the paper. Because of copy rights, however, it is necessary to obtain the data yourself first (for instructions see Zipf/data). 

data: All necessary data can be obtained from http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data (Brown), http://wordnet.princeton.edu (WordNet), http://corpus.nytud.hu/mnsz/index_eng.html (HNC), tst-centrale.org (CGN), and gutenberg.org (Melville's Moby Dick). The routines in this file can be used to develop the R objects required for Zipf/script.

alternatives: These codes can be used to reproduce the results of the alternative proposals discussed in the paper.
