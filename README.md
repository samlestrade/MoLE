R package for simulating language evolution in terms of cultural evolution. The focus is on the emergence of argument-marking systems (noun marking, person indexing, word order), but extensions are foreseen.

To run:
Set the model parameters in \code{world}. 
Found a new population (\code{FOUND}). 
Run a simulation (\code{RUN}).

For language to change (and argument-marking grammar to develop), the simulation has to run for several hours.
